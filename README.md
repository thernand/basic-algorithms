# basic-algorithms

- This is part of my series of algorithms for problem solving which I will documenting while I am learning a programming language. 
- This repository is dedicated to basic algorithms which wants to challenge me.
- Everytime I find a better solution, then I will add a new file with the new version suffix.
- Filenames are not following any programming language naming convention because I prefer to make it literally readable.

I hope this could be somehow useful for the community.
Regards!
